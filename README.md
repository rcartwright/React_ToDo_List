# React_ToDo_List
ReactJS To Do List

Built with React, Browserify, Node, and a hint of Express. Implemented with Facebook Flux and also React Router. Hashhistory is currently implemented instead of serverside rendering as of right now.
That's why there's a hash and characters at the end of the url.
